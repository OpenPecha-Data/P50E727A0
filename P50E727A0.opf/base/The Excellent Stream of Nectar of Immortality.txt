In the Water Sheep year of the seventeenth calendrical cycle (2003), in the glorious Dharma
encampment of Lerab Ling in France, as soon as we had finished a ceremony for increasing wealth
and prosperity called ‘The Excellent Vase of Jewels’ (a wealth practice from the Thukdrup
Barché Kunsel cycle, which was unearthed in Tibet), three ḍākinīs offered me a long
silk scarf and a small silver brooch bearing the auspicious symbols. Full of joy, they said
it would be extremely auspicious if I were to compose a long-life prayer for Sogyal Rinpoche.
Thus it was that this garland of words arising to my mind appeared on a sheet of white
paper, written by one whom Vajradhāra Padma Yeshé Dorjé (Jamyang Khyentsé Chökyi Lodrö),
Gyalwang Karmapa and other sublime beings recognized as Gyalchen Tulku, the activity incarnation
of Taksham Samten Lingpa, but who in reality is just an inferior person whose thoughts
are not beyond sensual pleasure, and who, having been given the name Orgyen Sönam Tobgyal
by Sakya Dakchen of the Puntsok Podrang, is known simply as Orgyen Tobgyal. May it be
meaningful! Sarva mangalaṃ!

Prayer for the Long Life of Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche
by Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche

lumé kön chok sum dang tsawa sum
Through the blessings of the unfailing Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and guru, yidam deity and
ḍākinī,
bima pejung yabyum tuk jin gyi
Together with Vimalamitra, Guru Padmākara and consort,
orgyen tobgyal kutsé lo gyar ten
May the life of Orgyen Tobgyal remain secure for a hundred years,
lab chen ten drö dön chen tarchin shok
And may vast waves of benefit for the teachings and beings be accomplished!

Although several great masters have already composed many poetic prayers for my long life with
the kind of pure vision that sees even dirt as gold, when these are recited in the assembly
of monks, they become a source of embarrassment, as I don’t possess any of the praiseworthy
qualities mentioned. I therefore wrote this verse of aspiration for my own longevity
so that it could be recited during group practice.
